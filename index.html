<h1>How to improve your basketball shot</h1>

<h3>1) Start in a wide stance </h1>
<p>Bend your knees and square your shoulders to the basket. Always make sure you are balanced when shooting.</p>

<h3>2) Jump straight up</h2>
<p>Never jump to the side, forward or backwards (If you are not trying to).</p>

<h3>3) Explode upward and shoot the ball</h3>
<p>Make sure that you're shooting the ball on the way up.</p>

<h3>4) Keep your elbow straight while you shoot.</h4>
<p>That means your elbow is always pointed in the direction of the basket.</p>

<h3>5) Flick your wrist straight.</h5>
<p>Hold your follow-through until the ball goes through the hoop. All of the ball's momentum and spin should come from your wrist. The power for the shot is provided by your legs.</p>

<h3>6) Shoot the ball in a high arc.</h6>
<p>The ball should be at its highest point 2/3 of the way towards the rim. When shooting, think of your shot as going up and out. The balance of the two is what makes a jump shot go in.</p>

<h3>7) Snap your wrist as you release the ball.</h3>
<p>Your hand should look like you are about to put it in a cookie jar. This movement gives the ball backspin.</p>

<h3>8) Focus on the BEEF acronoym.</h3>
<p>B is for balance, E is for eye, E is for Elbow, and F is for Following through. Remember to always face the basket and be balanced.</p>

<h3>9) Land facing the rim.</h3>
<p>Never land facing the wall or have your feet pointing anywhere else than the rim.</p>
